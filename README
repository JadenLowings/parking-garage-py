DB = mongoDB Atlas
Framework = Flask

Dependencies are shown in requirements.txt
To setup env run command '$ pip install -r requirements.txt'

Pipfile and Pipfile.lock were requirements to use the app on
heroku's platform.

Timeline:

    * Porting the project to work as a web based application. (2 Days)
    * Combining through code to improve performance. (1 Day)

Where I struggled:

    * Understanding how the Framework handled requests.
    * Figuring out how Python could display variables in HTML through Django
    * Attempting to put the app on Heroku.

What I enjoyed:

    * Mongo's ability to create tables on input from the application.
    * Connecting the app to mongo and displaying it through HTML and Django.
